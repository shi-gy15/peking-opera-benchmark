## Cross-model Analytical Workloads

Specifications for task $T_1$ to $T_6$ are written in ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) and OrientDB SQL (OSQL) formats respectively in `./experiments/polystore-evaluation/`.

Evaluation results are summarized in `./experiments/polystore-evaluation/`. The mean latency (in milliseconds) of each query is calculated as the mean value of five identical executions, with query cache disabled.
